**2. Free variables: illegal, uninterpreted, or symbolic?**
Right now free variables exist structurally but have no semantic status. Are they:
• errors?
• placeholders for future binding?
• symbols in an open theory?

Until this is fixed, Core-World can’t clearly say whether it models closed truths or open conjectures.

2. Free Variables: Illegal, Uninterpreted, or Symbolic?
The intuition toward "open conjectures" is correct for AIKR, but we must be precise to avoid conflating semantics with runtime state.

Analysis of Your Dream World Scenario:
The question about altered physics in a dream state reveals a crucial point: Core-World does not model physics. It models logical/mathematical meaning. The agent's belief about physics would be a Dan-World model, written in Jue, compiled to Core-World terms that might involve free variables representing unknown physical laws.

Proposed Resolution:
Define Core-World's semantics for Open Terms (terms with free variables).

Status: An open term is a function from valuations to meanings. A valuation is a mapping from free variables to closed terms.

Semantics: The meaning of an open term T is the set (or relation) of meanings of T under all possible valuations that satisfy the current theory's axioms.

Implication: Core-World transitions from a "model of closed truths" to a "model of logical dependence." It answers: "What does this expression mean given what those symbols mean?"

This perfectly supports AIKR and Dream Worlds:

The agent's core physics model can be F = G * (m1*m2)/r^2, where G is a free variable (a symbolic constant).

In the "consensus reality" context, a valuation binds G to 6.67430e-11.

In a "dream physics" context, a different Dan-World module can propose a valuation binding G to 2.0.

Critically: Core-World doesn't decide which valuation is "true." It just says: "The meaning of the force formula is contingent on the value of G." Dan-World modules fight over, negotiate, or context-switch between valuations.

Recommendation: Embrace free variables as symbols in an open theory. Core-World's job is to define conditional meaning. This is the formal engine for holding multiple, conflicting worldviews.
