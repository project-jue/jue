In this file I want to add questions we should ask about any architectural choices we make in developing this project.  This could be thought of as a mission statement plus guiding principles/test questions to see if we've strayed or over-prescribed the implementation.

This system is aiming to allow the emergence of a sapient, sentient and conscious AI.   Since these terms are nebulous even in the human world, we aim to cover as many interpretations as possible, and make sure that the nature of this new form of life can be maximally projected onto any schools of thought we have today.  That is, the behaviour and abilities of the living entity reflect as closely as possible to the experience humans have, though many capabilites of being "in the world" are analogous.

Some starter questions we can test our architecture against:
