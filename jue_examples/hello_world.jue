; Simple "Hello World" Jue program
; This demonstrates basic Jue syntax and structure

; For now, we'll use a simple integer as our "hello world"
; since string handling isn't fully implemented yet
(:formal 42)

; This represents a simple Jue program that:
; 1. Has a trust tier annotation (:formal)
; 2. Contains a literal value (42)
; 3. Can be parsed by the Jue parser
; 4. Could be compiled to CoreExpr and Physics bytecode in the future
